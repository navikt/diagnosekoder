# Tests for diagnosekode lib

This directory contains some unit tests of the diagnosekode project.

Since this is such a small project and not much test code is believed to be needed, we have written the tests without using any third party test library, to prevent a lot of dependencies creeping into the project.

Use the `npm run test` command to build and then execute the main *test* function in [test.ts](./test.ts) This should then run all the test functions.
